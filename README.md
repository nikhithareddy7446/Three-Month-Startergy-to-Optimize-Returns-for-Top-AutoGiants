**Abstract** : In today’s dynamic financial landscape, optimizing investment returns while managing risk remains a paramount objective for investors. This project present an integrated approach of time-series forecast and financial analysis to develop a strategic investment framework for an automative industry. Leveraging historical data sourced from Yahoo Finance API, we utilize advance time-series forecasting model such as **_Prophet_** _to_ **predict future returns** for leading automotive companies and construct a robust **investment strategy** spanning a **next three-month** horizon

- The project aims to develop a robust **investment strategy** on the **adjusted closing price** of the stock within **automotive sector** for a next **three-month** horizon.
- Utilizing historical data from [Yahoo Finance API](https://finance.yahoo.com/) over the past two years, we employ advanced time-series forecasting models like **Prophet** to predict future returns for key automotive companies within the S&P 500, including _Tesla, BMW, Mercedes, Ferrari, Toyota Motors, Stellantis, and Honda Motors._
- Integrating concepts from the Capital Asset Pricing Model **(CAPM)** and Security Market Line **(SML),** we estimate expected returns and evaluate market risk systematically.
- Employing **mean-variance optimization** principles and insights from CAPM, we construct an **optimized portfolio** to maximize returns while diversifying risk exposure.
- Performance evaluation metrics, such as the **Sharpe ratio**, are utilized to rigorously assess the effectiveness of the investment strategy
